### This README is brought to you by excessive caffeine and an unhealthy love for code.
Hi! I'm Elkyw, I like dogs and books. Ok that was a horrible way to introduce myself.

I like Engineering, and Software, basically anything with technology. No I do not make, or plan on making any tutorials, I'm not good at explaining anything

Some quick fun facts about me:

1. Just tried to be funny

2. 16 Years Old

3. 97 WPM peak typing speed

5. Proud Linux User

6. Imo im excessively clever

From now on forward i would probably created projects much here, maybe a project every week, depending on what I am working on and if it's worth showing or not, I will try... my best to post creative stuff here !

Apart from that, I am always down for collaborations :)
